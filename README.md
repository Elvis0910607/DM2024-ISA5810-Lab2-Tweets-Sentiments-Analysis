# DM2024-ISA5810-Lab2-Tweets-Sentiments-Analysis
### Description
In this competition, we provide a dataset which was crawled from Twitter, and we have already labeled the emotion for these tweets by some specific hashtags in the original text. There are 8 classes (or say emotions) in our dataset: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, trust, and joy.
You have to clean the data by doing some pre-processing first. Then, apply feature engineering or any other data mining technique. The final goal is to learn a model that is able to predict the emotion behind each tweet.
### Data
-tweets_DM.json - Raw data from Twitter
-emotion.csv - Lists the emotion labels per tweet_id
-data_identification.csv - A file that identifies membership of training or testing set per tweet_id. Note that you wonÂ´t be provided with the labels for the testing set, but you will have to predict these when you make your submission.
